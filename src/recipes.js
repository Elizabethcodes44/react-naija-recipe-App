This version relies on a ton of fresh vegetables, Beef Liver, and a little bit of oil for crisping it up.The added beef liver gives the fried Rice a very nice rich but subtle taste, and this is why it is one of the most popular choices in Nigeria. Though you can also use Shrimp or any protein you`d like.  If you would love to make vegan fried rice, you can omit the Beef liver or Shrimps entirely! This fried rice is entirely different from the popular Asian Chicken Fried Rice because the depth of the taste in the latter comes from the Soy sauce while the depth of taste of the latter comes from the Curry powder, Thyme, Seasoning cubes, and of course the abundance of vegetables like Carrots, Green beans, Peas, sweet corn, and Onions.",
